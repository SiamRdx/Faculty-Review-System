               <P>Online Faculty Review System,
here we have developed the a faculty feedback system, which is generally used in the university to rate the faculty based on the performance...Here we have 2 modules such as administrator, student.

Administrator is the one who creates the student account by adding all student info and assigning the username and password. 
Admin also checks the result once all students entered the feedback.
We can start the demonstration from the login page, where we have given the option to login as admin and student.

You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account and check result.

If you enter the student user and password and select student option, then it will show all of students' information and let you enter the feedback based on the subject.
